Hey people, this is my collection of solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles in Python. 

if you are stuck, here you might find some inspiration how to solve the puzzles.

I am currently learning, so the solutions are by no means optimized, this is just for fun and to get better at coding.

Website to solve yourself: [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)

If you have any questions (because of my bad commentary or anything else) fell free to reach out to me :-)

Happy Coding <br />
Moses
